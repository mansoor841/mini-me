# Building a Mini-Language Model from Scratch

A comprehensive guide to understanding and building a small-scale replica of a modern large language model (LLM) like GPT. This project is designed as an educational journey through the fundamentals of AI, machine learning, and natural language processing.

> **Disclaimer:** This is a learning guide. Building a true replica of a state-of-the-art LLM (e.g., GPT-4) requires immense computational resources, data, and research teams far beyond the scope of an individual project. The goal here is to understand the principles and build a functional *miniature* version.

## The Learning Path (Curriculum)

This project is broken down into four sequential phases. Master each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: The Foundation - Prerequisites
**Objective:** Learn the essential tools and languages.

1.  **Python Programming**
    *   Install Python and an IDE (VS Code or PyCharm are excellent).
    *   Learn core concepts: variables, data types, loops, conditionals, and functions.
    *   Key Libraries: Install and learn the basics of `numpy` and `pandas`.

2.  **Basic Mathematics (Intuition)**
    *   **Linear Algebra:** Vectors, matrices, and operations (dot product).
    *   **Calculus:** The concept of derivatives and gradients (for learning).
    *   **Statistics & Probability:** Distributions and basic probability.

3.  **Data Manipulation**
    *   Learn to load, clean, and manipulate data using `pandas`.

### Phase 2: The Engine - Machine Learning
**Objective:** Understand how neural networks learn.

1.  **Core Concepts**
    *   Understand Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning.
    *   Learn the process of **Training** vs. **Testing** on datasets.

2.  **Neural Networks**
    *   **Perceptron:** The simplest building block.
    *   **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):** Combining neurons into networks.
    *   **Activation Functions:** ReLU, Sigmoid.
    *   **Loss Function:** Measuring model error.
    *   **Backpropagation & Optimizers (e.g., Adam):** The algorithms for learning from mistakes.

    **ðŸŽ¯ Project 1:** Build a neural network to classify handwritten digits (MNIST dataset) using `scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow/PyTorch`.

### Phase 3: The Special Sauce - NLP & Transformers
**Objective:** Specialize in language processing.

1.  **NLP Fundamentals**
    *   **Tokenization:** Splitting text into words/subwords.
    *   **Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec):** Representing words as numerical vectors.

2.  **The Transformer Architecture**
    *   **Self-Attention Mechanism:** The core innovation that allows a model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence.
    *   **Transformer Block:** Composed of Multi-Head Attention and a Feed-Forward Network.
    *   Models are built by stacking many of these blocks.

    **ðŸŽ¯ Project 2:** Use the Hugging Face `transformers` library to experiment with a pre-trained model like `DistilGPT-2` for text generation.

### Phase 4: Build Your "Mini-Me"
**Objective:** Assemble everything into a small-scale language model.

1.  **Data Preparation**
    *   **Acquisition:** Source a text corpus (e.g., books from Project Gutenberg, Wikipedia articles).
    *   **Cleaning:** Remove junk HTML, normalize text.
    *   **Tokenization:** Process your entire dataset with a tokenizer (e.g., GPT-2's tokenizer).

2.  **Model Architecture**
    *   Define a small Transformer model in PyTorch/TensorFlow.
    *   Key hyperparameters to choose:
        *   `d_model`: Embedding dimension (e.g., 512)
        *   `n_layers`: Number of Transformer blocks (e.g., 6)
        *   `n_heads`: Number of attention heads (e.g., 8)
        *   `vocab_size`: Size of your tokenizer's vocabulary

3.  **Training Loop**
    *   **Task:** Causal Language Modeling (predicting the next word).
    *   **Process:** Feed data, calculate loss, run backpropagation, update parameters with an optimizer.
    *   **Scale:** This requires significant time and a powerful GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3090/A100).

4.  **Evaluation & Deployment**
    *   Evaluate the model's performance on a held-out test set.
    *   Write an inference script to generate text from prompts.

## Getting Started Realistically

1.  **Do not start from scratch.** First, understand how to use existing models.
2.  **Follow tutorials** for Phase 2 and Project 1.
3.  **For the Transformer,** study and run existing minimal implementations like [**NanoGPT**](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) on a small dataset (e.g., Shakespeare). This is the most effective way to learn.
